    "dataSourcesText": "EcoMonitor integrates environmental data from multiple authoritative sources to ensure accuracy and reliability. For air quality, we utilize IQAir's global monitoring network, which provides professional-grade AQI measurements and pollutant concentrations. We also incorporate data from AQICN (Air Quality Index China Network) and local government monitoring stations operated by Uzbekistan's environmental agencies. Weather data comes from OpenWeatherMap's comprehensive meteorological service, which aggregates information from thousands of weather stations worldwide. Additionally, we work with local universities, research institutions, and citizen science initiatives to expand our data coverage. All data sources are continuously validated, cross-referenced, and quality-checked to maintain the highest standards of accuracy. Our API infrastructure ensures seamless data flow, with intelligent caching systems that guarantee platform reliability even during network disruptions.",
